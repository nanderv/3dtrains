# 3dtrains
My own designs for narrow gauge locomotives, intended to be 3d printed for a model railway.

## Scale
The trains are H0e scale, which is H0-scale, but with a trackwidth that would emulate around 760mm in real life. The trackwidth is thus the same as n-gauge.

## Frame
The locos can be made runners by adding a kato 11-109 chassis, which is available in quite a lot of webshops, generally for below around 25â‚¬.
